# cleaner-cli
A command line interface that keeps your otherwise messy desktop presentable. Installations should be as simple as forking or downloading and then

```
pip install "path/to/your/local/repo"
```  
After installing you can run
```
cd folder/to/clean
clean -f "filetypes"
```
to tidy up the folder you're currently in.

Also this is very much in development, and not very useful after all.
